Usage

oprdb - makes offprint of website databases
  oprdb toxodb.org
    makes offprint of application and user databases
  Options:
    --only-userdb
      make offprint of user database
    --only-appdb
      make offprint of application database
    --skip-scrub
      make exact offprint, do not remap data
        Use this option for internally hosted sites, say for public access to previous releases.
        The default is to scrub sensitive data like passwords and contact information.
  
  
oprdb makes http requests to the source website /dashboard to learn the connection string of the application and user databases. 

Network links are created in the destination databases using the full connection descriptor, (DESCRIPTION=...(HOST=...)) . Using the explicit descriptor instead of tns names or aliases avoids ambiguity (e.g. 'apicommS' resolves to different databases on the source and destination servers).





oprw - make offprint of EuPathDB WDK-based component website. (Not suited for portal, not OrthoMCL)
